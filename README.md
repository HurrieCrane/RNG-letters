# RNG-letters
Here is is accompanying code to the images I've produced (https://www.artstation.com/artwork/JznKz) for generating randomly shaped letters into SVGs.

<b>Generating letters</b>

If you want to generate some letters then you need to compile and run the program yourself in Visual Studio or run \bin\Debug\RNG Letters.exe When you run the program a folder will be made on your desktop named "RNGLetters" which contains 26 SVGs.

<b>What to do with the SVGs</b>

If you want to simply look at the SVG then you can open it in the browser however it will most likely be very small, however if you want to edit the SVG then you'll need software like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.

<b>Changing parameters</b>

If you want to change purely aesthetic paramiters then you can do that in other software, if you want to change things like how many letters are generated then you'll have to edit the code.
