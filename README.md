# RNG-letters
TODO:A description of your project follows. A good description is clear, short, and to the point. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does.
Here is is accompanying code to the images I've produced (https://www.artstation.com/artwork/JznKz) for generating randomly shaped letters into SVGs.

# Table of Contents
TODO: Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly naviagte especially long or detailed READMEs.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
(Preperatrion to install)

### Installation
Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

## Usage
TODO: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

### Generating letters

If you want to generate some letters then you need to compile and run the program yourself in Visual Studio or run \bin\Debug\RNG Letters.exe When you run the program a folder will be made on your desktop named "RNGLetters" which contains 26 SVGs.

### What to do with the SVGs

If you want to simply look at the SVG then you can open it in the browser however it will most likely be very small, however if you want to edit the SVG then you'll need software like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.

### Changing parameters

If you want to change purely aesthetic paramiters then you can do that in other software, if you want to change things like how many letters are generated then you'll have to edit the code.
